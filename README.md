# Compulsory-Task---Javascript

● Create a file called cars.html. You are going to create a webpage for a car
salesman. The page will display details about cars that are for sale. Create
whatever HTML you deem appropriate for this task and style the page as
you like. However, be sure that the information about the cars for sale are
displayed on the webpage programmatically (see the next point) - not hard
coded with HTML.
● Create a file cars.js. Within cars.js:
o Create 5 car objects using a constructor function.
o Each car object should have the following properties: make, model,
colour, image, registration number, price.
o Each car object should also include a showMore() method. This
method should display a dialogue that displays all the details about
the specific car object. Hint: See more about <dialog> here.
o Create a function that will be used to display the make, model and
image of each car object in ‘cars.html’ when ‘cars.html’ is loaded.
● Whenever a user clicks on an image of a car, the showMore() method
should be called and all the information about the car, including the
registration number, price etc should be displayed.
